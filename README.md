I am a Senior Biostatistician and Epidemiologist at Cincinnati Children's Hospital with a strong foundation in statistical modeling, spatial analysis, and reproducible research workflows. I lead data-driven investigations into environmental and social determinants of health using R. My work focuses on advancing population health through rigorous, scalable methods for integrating geospatial and clinical data.
